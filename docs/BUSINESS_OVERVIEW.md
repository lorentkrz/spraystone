# Spraystone Facade Simulator - Business Overview

## Purpose

The Spraystone Facade Simulator is a digital pre-quote and visualization tool for facade renovation projects. It helps potential customers understand options, see a likely outcome, and get a fast budget range before a site visit.

## Who It Helps

- Customers who want a quick, clear view of what a facade upgrade could look like and cost
- Sales teams who need qualified leads and consistent first estimates
- Operations teams who want complete project info before scheduling a visit
- Marketing teams who want higher conversion from web traffic

## Business Workflow (High Level)

1. Capture lead and project details through a guided form
2. Collect a facade photo for visual context
3. Generate a tailored recommendation, estimated budget range, and timeline
4. Show a before/after visual concept
5. Present next steps to move the customer into a consultation or site visit

## What Data Is Collected

- Address and property location
- Facade type and condition
- Surface area or size range
- Desired finish and optional treatments
- Preferred timeline
- Contact details and call-back preference
- Current facade photo

## What The Customer Receives

- Plain language assessment of the facade

## Business Benefits

- Faster response to inquiries without waiting for a site visit

## What It Is Not

## How To Use It In Sales

- Use the output as a conversation starter for a follow-up call
- Use the estimate and visuals to set expectations before a visit

## Success Metrics To Track
